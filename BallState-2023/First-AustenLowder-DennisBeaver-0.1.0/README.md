Project summary:
This project is about taking username, time and revisions from a wiki api link. Where the user can put anyname they want and it will collect the JSON data from the api link and format it in a way that is readable to the user. It will provide whether or not their are redirects and whether it errors out or not. This will allow for users to search any name they want and find the most recent 27 changes and what users did them.

Instructions:
To run the program go to the "main" class and run it. After that type in whatever name you wish and your data will be ruturned to you!
