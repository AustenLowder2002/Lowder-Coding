        <h1>Six Paragraphs</h1> 
		<p class= "p1"><span>Paragraph One:</span> This is a very short paragaph. 
					   By short I mean very very short. 
					   Maybe even too short to be considered a paragraph</p>
		<p class= "p2"><span>Paragraph Two:</span> I must really enjoy very short paragraphs,
												   because I keep writing them. I really enjoy changing the colors and things around.</p>
		<p class= "p3"><span>Paragraph Three:</span> All paragaphs are different or are they? I guess you may need to pay close attention to each 
													 Paragraph. I trust you to figure out the difference in due time my young padawan.</p>
		<p class="p1"><span>Paragraph Four:</span> This is a very similar short paragaph. 
					   By similar I mean very similar and very short. 
					   Maybe even too short to be considered a paragraph</p>
		<p class= "p2"><span>Paragraph Five:</span> This is a very similar short paragaph. 
					   You might even confuse the paragraphs together but I promise they are different.
					   Just not by much.</p>
		<p class= "p3"><span>Paragraph Six:</span> This is the final short paragaph. 
					   You might even confuse the paragraphs every paragraph together 
					   but I promise they are different. They really arent different but much though.
